# Balatro: Donuts Mod

A simple mod created by me that plans on adding plenty of jokers, consumables, and other silly things

Requires both [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and the most recent release of [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) to function properly 

Download and unzip the main folder in %APPDATA%/Balatro/Mods and you're ready to go!

# Known issues

Doughnut (refreshment) and Sparkling Water in consumeable slots cause a crash with Cryptid when a hand is played
